# Standard ML of New Jersey

The [**Standard ML of New Jersey** (**SML/NJ**)](https://smlnj.org) project is an open-source
implementation of the [Standard ML Programming Language](https://github.com/SMLFamily).

There are two main repositories:

* The ["legacy"](https://github.com/smlnj/legacy) repository contains the source
  for the 110.99 patch releases.  This version is being maintained as a stable
  version while we make more radical changes in the development version.
  It supports older architectures (*e.g.*, the PowerPC and Sparc) and 32-bit
  executables.<br/>
  To report bugs in the legacy versions, use the
  [legacy issue tracker](https://github.com/smlnj/legacy/issues).

* The ["development"](https://github.com/smlnj/smlnj) is the latest version of
  the system.  We are making substantial changes to the runtime system and compiler
  backend in this repository, so it is not recommended for production work.<br/>
  To report bugs in the development version, use the
  [development issue tracker](https://github.com/smlnj/smlnj/issues).

Information about the implementation of **SML/NJ** (including future plans)
can be found in the [**SML/NJ** Developer Notes](https://github.com/smlnj/smlnj/wiki).
