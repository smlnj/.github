# Standard ML of New Jersey

The [**Standard ML of New Jersey** (**SML/NJ**)](https://smlnj.org) project is an open-source
implementation of the [Standard ML Programming Language](https://github.com/SMLFamily).

## Repositories

There are two main repositories:

* The ["legacy"](https://github.com/smlnj/legacy) repository
  (smlnj/legacy) contains the source
  for the 110.99 patch releases.  This version is being maintained as a stable
  version while we make more radical changes in the development version.
  It supports older architectures (*e.g.*, the PowerPC and Sparc) and 32-bit
  executables.<br/>
  The latest legacy release is
  [110.99.8](https://smlnj.org/dist/working/110.99.8/index.html).<br/>
  To report bugs in the legacy versions, use the
  [legacy issue tracker](https://github.com/smlnj/legacy/issues).

* The ["development"](https://github.com/smlnj/smlnj) repository (smlnj/smlnj)
  is the latest version of the system.  We are making substantial changes to the
  runtime system and compiler backend in this repository, so it is not recommended
  for production work.<br/>
  The latest development release is
  [2025.2](https://smlnj.org/dist/working/2025.2/index.html).<br/>
  To report bugs in the development version, use the
  [development issue tracker](https://github.com/smlnj/smlnj/issues).

* Other issues, such as broken links on website or documentation errors should
  be reported using the [project issue tracker](https://github.com/smlnj/.github/issues).

## Sources of Information

* The [**SML/NJ** website](https://smlnj.org).

* Information about the implementation of **SML/NJ** (including future plans)
  can be found in the [**SML/NJ** Wiki](https://github.com/smlnj/.github/wiki).
